"So Marked One, I saved you, but I'm not going to be pretending I did it to win favors upstairs. You do some jobs for me and we're even. Besides, keeping you busy might be a good way to deal with your amnesia. I'll see what I can find about this Strelok guy. I don't give a shit why you want this Strelok guy and mind my own busness. If you want to kill him.. Well.. You must have your reasons."

Welcome to **The STALKER Developers Library** (**SDL**), a project which aims to document and centralize the immense tribal knowledge of the Halo modding community. This is an unofficial resource by modders, for modders.

_Mods_ are fan-made modifications to a game that change or add content, or implement unofficial bug fixes and new features. STALKER has a 20+ year tradition of modding which is still going strong. On SDL we focus on today's best practices and tools.

Everyone makes mods for different reasons; maybe it's to rebalance the sandbox, learn new skills, expand on a favourite game, or curiosity about how the game works. Regardless, we hope this resource can help you.

**This website is always a work in progress!** We especially need more information for various builds and engines. Please [contribute info](~contributing) if you can.
