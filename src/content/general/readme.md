Modding means different things to different people, but this site focuses on using the official [mod tools](~mod-tools) to create new or modified content for the games in the stalker series.

# A foreword
It's important to set some expectations before we begin. Halo modding is a niche hobby and [official documentation](https://sdk.stalker-game.com/en/index.php?title=S.T.A.L.K.E.R._MOD_portal) is limited or outdated. Until recently, we were never the intended audience of [these tools](~mod-tools) and they sometimes lack the useability expected of public products. Despite the long history of STALKER modding, discoveries are still being made in 2024 about how the games work.

Compared to powerful modern products like _Unity_ or _Unreal_, [STALKER's engine](~general/xray) is more specialized and often limited for the hardware of the time. You'll have an easier time working with the engine than against it.

We encourage you to **take things slowly**. People often start with a highly ambitious vision, only to get discouraged and give up entirely when they hit walls. You can spend years perfecting your craft in one area like level creation but still know nothing about another like animation. It's important to make small goals so you don't get overwhelmed. Remember that STALKERS's content was created by dozens of artists and designers over years of work.

Finally, keep your momentum up by learning how to [troubleshoot and ask for help](~help).
