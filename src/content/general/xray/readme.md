The **STALKER Engine**, also called **X-Ray**, is GSC's in-house proprietary engine used in all of the STALKER games. Each version added or removed capabilities and had systems overhauled.

There are two main groups of engine generations where the asset pipelines and features tend to differ from each other:

* X-Ray.
* X-Ray 2.
